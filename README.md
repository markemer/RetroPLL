# RetroPLL

## Project Goal
With the increase in Retrocomputing Projects and other DIY projects that need slow clocks at high voltages (3.3, 5V) a new PLL that delivers clock speeds from DC - 50MHz (TBD) would be a helpful chip. Very few modern PLL chips offer this. Currently I am targeting MPW-7 on [Open Shuttle Program](https://platform.efabless.com/open_shuttle_program)
